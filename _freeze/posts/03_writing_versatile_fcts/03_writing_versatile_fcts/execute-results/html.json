Take parameters.\n2. Simulate stochastic processes with these parameters.\n3. Summarize processes\n\nThus, in step 1 the generating function which we want to code, needs to be versatile enough to handle different argument names and amounts.\nNext, let's see what the `dat` column has in store for us.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_A %>% pluck(\"dat\", 1) %>% head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      n proc_mean\n  <int>     <dbl>\n1     1    -1.01 \n2     2    -0.958\n3     3    -0.968\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat_B %>% pluck(\"dat\", 1) %>% head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n      n proc_variance\n  <int>         <dbl>\n1     1          5.27\n2     2          2.66\n3     3          3.08\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirst of all, notice that I accessed the first tibble in the `dat` column using the super neat `pluck()` function.\nIn my opinion, this function is preferable to the clunky base R usage of `$` and `[[`, e.g. like `dat_A$dat[[1]]`.\n\nAs you can see, the tibbles that are saved in `dat` contain columns `n` and `proc_mean` resp. `proc_variance`.\nAs hinted at before, each row is supposed to represent a summary of the `n`-th realization of a stochastic process.\n\nHowever, notice that the summary statistics in use are not the same!\nThe different column names `proc_mean` and `proc_variance` indicate that in tibble A the sample mean was used whereas tibble B contains sample variances.\nAgain, our function that generates `tib_A` and `tib_B` should be flexible enough to create differently named and differently computed columns.\n\n## Helpful Concepts\n\nNow that we know what we want to create, let us begin by learning how to handle differently many arguments and their varying names.\n\n### dot-dot-dot\n\nFor these kinds of purposes, R offers the `...`-operator (pronounced dot-dot-dot).\nBasically, it serves as a placeholder for everything you do not want to evaluate immediately.\n\nFor instance, have you ever wondered how `dplyr`'s `select()` function is able to select the correct column?[^yards-reused]\nIf you're thinking \"No, but what's so special about this?\", then you may want to notice that it is actually not that simple to define your own `select()` function even with the help of the `dplyr` function.\n\nThis is because defining an appropriate function to select two columns from, say, the `iris` data set cannot be done like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_select <- function(x, y) {select(iris, x, y)}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, if you want to use the function the same way you would use `dplyr::select()`, i.e. simply passing, say, `Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length` (notice no `\"\"`) to your new function, it would look like this\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_select(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length)\n#> Error: object 'Sepal.Width' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis error appears because at some point, R will try to evaluate the arguments as variables from your current environment.\nBut of course this variable is not present in your environment and only present within the `iris` data set.\nTherefore, what `dplyr::select()` accomplishes is that it lets R know to evaluate the input argument only later on, i.e. when the variable from the data set is \"available\".\n\nThis is where `...` comes into play. \nIt is not by chance that `select()` only has arguments `.data` and `...`. \nHere, `select()` uses that everything which is thrown into `...`, will be passed along to be evaluated later.\nThis can save our `my_select()` function, too.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_select <- function(...) {select(iris, ...)}\nmy_select(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length) %>% head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sepal.Width Sepal.Length\n1         3.5          5.1\n2         3.0          4.9\n3         3.2          4.7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWorks like a charm!\nThis will help us to define a function that is flexible enough for our purposes.\nBefore we start with that, let us learn about another ingredient we will use.\n\n### curly-curly\n\nIf we were to only select a single column from `iris` using our `my_select()` function, we could have also written the function using `{{ }}` (pronounced curly-curly).\nIt operators similar to `...` in the sense that it allows for later evaluation but applies this concept to specific variable.\nCheck out how that can be used here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_select <- function(x) {select(iris, {{x}})}\nmy_select(Sepal.Width) %>% head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sepal.Width\n1         3.5\n2         3.0\n3         3.2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat's more the curly-curly variables - curly-curlied variables (?) - can also be used later on for stuff like naming a new column.\nFor example, let us modify our previous function to demonstrate how that can be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect_and_add <- function(x, y) {\n  select(iris, {{x}}) %>% \n    mutate({{y}} := 5) \n  # 5 can be replaced by some meaningful calculation\n}\nselect_and_add(\"Sepal.Width\", \"variable_y\") %>% head(3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Sepal.Width variable_y\n1         3.5          5\n2         3.0          5\n3         3.2          5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMind the colon!\nHere, if you want to use `y` as column name later on you cannot use the standard `mutate()` syntax but have to use `:=` instead.\n\n### Functional Programming\n\nOne last thing that we will use, is the fact that R supports functional programming.\nThus, we can use functions as arguments of other functions.\nFor instance, take a look at this super simple, yet somewhat useless wrapper function for illustration purposes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_simulate <- function(n, func) {\n  func(n)\n}\nset.seed(564)\nmy_simulate(5, rnorm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  0.4605501 -0.7750968 -0.7159321  0.6882645 -2.0544591\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you just witnessed, I simply passed `rnorm` (without a call using `()`) to `my_simulate` as the `func` argument such that `rnorm` is used whenever `func` is called.\nIn our use case, this functionality can be used to simulate different stochastic processes (that may depend on different parameters).\n\n## The Implementation\n\nAlright, we have assembled everything we need in order to create our `simulate_and_summarize_proc()` function.\nIn this example, the simulation of the stochastic processes will consist of simply calling `rnorm()` or `rexp()` but, of course, these functions can be substituted with arbitrarily complex simulation functions.\n\nWe will use `n_simus` as the amount of realizations that are supposed to be simulated and each realization will be of length `TMax`.\nFurther, we will use `...` to handle an arbitrary amount of parameters that are supposed to be passed to `simulation_func`.\nSo, let's implement the simulation part first (detailed explanations below).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimulate_and_summarize_proc <- \n  function(..., TMax, n_simus, simulation_func) {\n    argslist <- list(n = TMax, ...) %>% \n      map(~rep(., n_simus))\n    \n    tibble(\n      t = list(1:TMax),\n      n = 1:n_simus,\n      value = pmap(argslist, simulation_func)\n    ) \n  }\nset.seed(457)\nsimulate_and_summarize_proc(\n  mean = 1,\n  sd = 2,\n  TMax = 200, \n  n_simus = 3, \n  simulation_func = rnorm # arguments -> n, mean, sd\n) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  t               n value      \n  <list>      <int> <list>     \n1 <int [200]>     1 <dbl [200]>\n2 <int [200]>     2 <dbl [200]>\n3 <int [200]>     3 <dbl [200]>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this created three (simple) stochastic processes of length 200 using the parameters `mean = 1` and `sd = 2`.\nWe can validate that the correct parameters were used once we implement the summary functions.\n\nFirst, let us address the tricky part in this function.\nIn order to pass a list of arguments to `pmap()` that are then used with `simulation_func`, we first need to rearrange the lists a bit.\nAfter the first step, by simply putting everything from `...` into the list we have a list like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(n = 100, mean = 1, sd = 2) %>% str()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nList of 3\n $ n   : num 100\n $ mean: num 1\n $ sd  : num 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, we will need to have each variable in the list repeated `n_simus` time in order to simulate more than one realization.\nThus, we use `map()` to replicate:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(n = 200, mean = 1, sd = 2) %>% \n  map(~rep(., 3)) %>% \n  str()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nList of 3\n $ n   : num [1:3] 200 200 200\n $ mean: num [1:3] 1 1 1\n $ sd  : num [1:3] 2 2 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that calling `rep()` without `map()` does not cause an error but does not  deliver the appropriate format:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist(n = 100, mean = 1, sd = 2) %>% \n  rep(3) %>% \n  str()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nList of 9\n $ n   : num 100\n $ mean: num 1\n $ sd  : num 2\n $ n   : num 100\n $ mean: num 1\n $ sd  : num 2\n $ n   : num 100\n $ mean: num 1\n $ sd  : num 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, let us take the current output and implement the summary.\nTo do so, we will add another variables `summary_name` and `summary_func` to the function in order to choose a column name resp. a summary statistic. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsimulate_and_summarize_proc <- \n  function(..., TMax, n_simus, simulation_func, summary_name, summary_func) {\n    argslist <- list(n = TMax, ...) %>% \n      map(~rep(., n_simus))\n    \n    tibble(\n      t = list(1:TMax),\n      n = 1:n_simus,\n      value = pmap(argslist, simulation_func)\n    ) %>% #

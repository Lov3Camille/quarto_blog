Thus, I have to remind myself often to keep things simple.\nUsually, this makes a data visualization way more effective.\n\nLuckily, I found a neat [datawrapper blogpost](https://blog.datawrapper.de/10-ways-to-use-fewer-colors-in-your-data-visualizations/) by [Lisa Charlotte Muth](https://twitter.com/lisacmuth) that shows us how to reduce the use of colors.\n\nBut as I was reading the blog post, I found myself wondering how some of the mentioned principles could be implemented in ggplot.\nNaturally, I began experimenting and created a few example plots using fewer colors.\nThis post will show you how you can do that too.\n\n## Preliminaries\n\nFor completeness' sake, let me mention the basic settings I will use for all visualizations.\nHonestly, if you have no idea what happens in the following code chunk, just skip it. \nMore or less, this chunk makes sure that all plots are using `theme_minimal()` plus a small number of tweaks.\nThese tweaks are\n\n- The use of the [Fira Sans font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) with help from the `showtext` package.\n- The plot titles are aligned to the left, have some spacing around them and are colored using a color from the [Okabe Ito](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/) color palette. Ever since I read [Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), I am fond of this color palette as I find the colors nice and apparently it is also color-blind safe. \n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(showtext)\nfont_add_google(\"Fira Sans\", \"firasans\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\ntheme_customs <- theme(\n  text = element_text(family = 'firasans', size = 16),\n  plot.title.position = 'plot',\n  plot.title = element_text(\n    face = 'bold', \n    colour = thematic::okabe_ito(8)[6],\n    margin = margin(t = 2, r = 0, b = 7, l = 0, unit = \"mm\")\n  ),\n)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal() + theme_customs)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Show shades, not hues\n\nAlright, enough with the preliminaries.\nLet's count how many different car classes are represented in the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package.

So, no further comment on this data set.\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = class)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_four_ways_colors_more_efficiently_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nUgh, this is a colorful mess and sort of reminds me of the [gnome rainbow puking gif](https://giphy.com/gifs/gravity-falls-i-couldnt-put-it-up-last-night---because-either-id-flip-out-and-wosNsGaxczbIA).\nLet's reduce the color load by sticking to only three colors.\nTo differentiate between classes we will make some colors more transparent. \n\nThus, we need to create a new variable in our data set that lumps the classes into three groups (for the colors).\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Group classes into three groups (to reduce colors to 3)\ndat <- mpg %>% \n  mutate(\n    year = factor(year),\n    class_group = case_when(\n      class %in% c('2seater', 'compact', 'midsize') ~ \"grp1\",\n      class == 'minivan' ~ \"grp2\",\n      T ~ \"grp3\"\n    )\n  )\n```\n:::\n\nNow that this is done, we can map `fill` to our new `class_group` variable and the regular `class` variable to `alpha`.\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshades_plt <- dat %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = class_group, alpha = class)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Year',\n    y = 'Counts',\n    alpha = 'Class',\n    title = 'Show shades, not hues'\n  )\nshades_plt \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_four_ways_colors_more_efficiently_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nFor better control of the visuals let us manually create and assign colors and the transparency levels.\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Color-blind safe colors\ncolors <-  thematic::okabe_ito(3)\n# Possible levels of transparency (one for each class)\nalpha_max <- 1\nalpha_min <- 0.7\nalpha_vals <- c(\n  seq(alpha_max, alpha_min, length.out = 4), \n  seq(alpha_min, alpha_max, length.out = 4)[-1]\n)\nalpha_vals\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Tweak previous plot\nshades_plt <- shades_plt +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = alpha_vals)\nshades_plt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_four_ways_colors_more_efficiently_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nNext, let us consolidate the two legends into one.\nThis can be done via `guides()`.\nHere, the `fill` guide will be set to `guide_none()` to get rid of the `class_group` legend.\n\nAlso, the `alpha` guide needs to be manually overwritten via `override.aes` in `guide_legend()` using the color codes that we saved in the vector `colors`.\nThis way, the `alpha` legend will also depict the colors instead of only the transparency level.\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshades_plt <- shades_plt +\n  guides(\n    fill = guide_none(),\n    alpha = guide_legend(\n      override.aes = list(fill = colors[c(1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3)]\n      )\n    )\n  ) \nshades_plt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_four_ways_colors_more_efficiently_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Group categories together by color, but keep showing them\n\nSo, this already looks better.\nHowever, adjacent colored blocks now \"merge\" into each other. \nThis can make it hard to differentiate between classes.\n\nTo overcome this issue, add lines between blocks.\nLuckily, this is spectacularly easy and done by setting the `color` aesthetic in `geom_bar()` to white.\nHere's the complete code.\n\n::: {.cell fig.showtext='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, fill = class_group, alpha = class)) +\n  geom_bar(col = 'white') + # Add lines for distinction\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = alpha_vals) +\n  guides(\n    fill = guide_none(),\n    alpha = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = colors[c(1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3)]))\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = 'Year',\n    y = 'Counts',\n    alpha = 'Class',\n    title = 'Group categories together by color, \\nbut keep showing them'\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_four_ways_colors_more_efficiently_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Emphasize just one or a few categories\n\nNext, let us switch tracks and look at some other kind of data.\nAt [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime) you can find a lot of interesting data sets.\nOne of these contains survey information on who Americans spend their time with (in average minutes per day by age).

set color to distinguish bars better\n  )\n```\n\nNotice that I used the `group`- instead of `fill`-aesthetic because I only need grouping. \nAlso, it is always a good idea to avoid [excessive use of colors](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-02-19-ggplot2-color-tips-from-datawrapper/).\nThis will allow us to emphasize parts of our story with colors later on.\n\n## Add reference points\n\nAnother good idea it to put your data into perspective.\nTo do so, include a reference point.\nThis can be a summary statistic like the average error rate.\nFor more great demonstration of reference points you can also check out [the evolution of a ggplot by CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/).\n\n```{r}\naverages <- dat_long %>% \n  group_by(type) %>% \n  summarise(percent = mean(percent)) %>% \n  mutate(id = 'ALL') \n\ndat_with_summary <- categorial_dat %>% \n  bind_rows(averages)\n\ndat_with_summary %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = percent, y = id)) +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(group = factor(type, levels = c('error', 'null', 'accuracy'))),\n    col = 'white',\n  )\n```\n\n\n## Order your data\n\nTo allow your reader to gain a quick overview, put your data into some form of sensible ordering.\nThis eases the burden of having to make sense of what the visual shows.\nAlso, notice that we already did part of that.\nSee, with the order of the levels in the `group` aesthetic, we influenced the ordering of the stacked bars.\nHere, we made sure that important quantities start at the left resp. right edges.\n\nWhy is that helpful, you ask?\nWell, the bars that start on the left all start at the same reference point.\nTherefore comparisons are quite easy for these bars.\nThe same holds true for the right edge.\nConsequently, it is best that we reserve these vip seats for the important data.\nCheck out what happens if I were to put the accuracy in the middle.\n\n```{r}\ndat_with_summary %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = percent, y = id)) +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(group = factor(type, levels = c('error', 'accuracy', 'null'))),\n    col = 'white',\n  )\n```\n\nNow, we can't really make out which warehouses have a higher accuracy.\nGiven that the accuracy is likely something we care about, this is bad.\nBut we can change the order even more.\nFor instance, we can also order the bars by error rate.\nHere, `fct_reorder()` is our friend.\n\n```{r}\nordered_dat <- dat_with_summary %>% \n  mutate(\n    type = factor(type, levels = c('error', 'null', 'accuracy')),\n    id = fct_reorder(id, percent, .desc = T)\n  ) \n\nordered_dat %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = percent, y = id)) +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(group = type),\n    col = 'white',\n  )\n```\n\n## Highlight your story points\n\nNext, it's time to highlight your story points.\nThis can be done with the `gghighlight` as I have demonstrated [in another blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-02-19-ggplot2-color-tips-from-datawrapper/#emphasize-just-one-or-a-few-categories).\nAlternatively, we can set the colors manually.\nThe latter approach gave me the best results in this case, so we'll go with that.\nBut I am still a big fan of `gghighlight`, so don't discard its power just yet.\n\n```{r}\n# Set colors as variable for easy change later\nunhighlighted_color <- 'grey80'\nhighlighted_color <- '#E69F00'\navg_error <- 'black'\navg_rest <- 'grey40'\n\n# Compute new column with colors of each bar\ncolored_dat <- ordered_dat %>% \n  mutate(\n    custom_colors = case_when(\n      id == 'ALL' & type == 'error' ~ avg_error,\n      id == 'ALL' ~ avg_rest,\n      type == 'error' & percent > 0.1 ~ highlighted_color,\n      T ~  unhighlighted_color\n    )\n  )\n\np <- colored_dat %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = percent, y = id)) +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(group = type),\n    col = 'white',\n    fill = colored_dat$custom_colors # Set colors manually\n  )\np\n```\n\nNotice how your eyes are immediately drawn to the intended region.\nThat's the power of colors!\nAlso, note that setting the colors manually like this worked because `fill` in `geom_col()` is vectorized.\nThis is not always the case.\nIn these instances, you may find that [functional programming solves your problem](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-03-25-functional-programming-when-geoms-are-not-vectorized/).\n\n## Remove axes expansion and allow drawing outside of grid\n\nDid you notice that there is still some clutter in the plot?\nRemoving clutter from a plot is a central element of the SWD look.\nPersonally, I like this approach. \nSo, let's get down to the essentials and remove what does not need to be there.\nIn this case, there are still (faint) horizontal lines behind each bar.\nFurthermore, this causes the warehouse IDs to be slightly removed from the bars.\nWe change that through formatting the coordinate system with `coord_cartesian()`.\n\n```{r}\np <- p +\n  coord_cartesian(\n    xlim = c(0, 1), \n    ylim = c(0.5, 20.5), \n    expand = F, # removes white spaces at edge of plot\n    clip = 'off' # allows drawing outside of panel\n  )\np\n```\n\nHere, we turned off the expansion to avoid wasting white space.\nNow, the IDs are at their designated place and we do not see lines from their names to the bars anymore.\nIf you want even more power on the space expansion you can leave `expand = T` and modify the expansion for each axis with `scale_*_continuous()` and the `expansion()` function.\nCheck out [Christian Burkhart's neat cheatsheet](https://twitter.com/ChBurkhart/status/1492087527511052290/photo/1) that teaches you everything you need to understand expansions.\n\nOn an unrelated note, you may wonder why I set `clip = 'off'`.\nThis little secret will be revealed soon. \nFor now, just know that it allows you to draw geoms outside the regular panel.\n\n## Move and format axes\n\nYou may have noticed that the x-axis in the finished plot is at the top of the panel rather than at the bottom.\nWhile that is unusual, it helps the reader to get straight to the point as the data is in view earlier.\nThis assumes that the eyes of a typical dataviz reader will first look at the top left corner and then zigzag downwards.\n\nIn `ggplot2`, moving the axes and setting the break points happens in a scale layer.\nIt is here where we use the `scales::percent()` function to transform the axes labels.\nAdditionally, changing labels happens in `labs()` and the remaining axes and text changes happen in `theme()`.\n\n\n```{r}\nunhighlighed_col_darker <- 'grey60'\np <- p +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2),\n    labels = scales::percent,\n    position = 'top'\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = 'Accuracy rates for highest volume warehouses',\n    y = 'WAREHOUSE ID',\n    x = '% OF TOTAL ORDERS FULFILLED',\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.line.x = element_line(colour = unhighlighed_col_darker),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = unhighlighed_col_darker),\n    axis.text = element_text(colour = unhighlighed_col_darker),\n    text = element_text(colour = unhighlighed_col_darker),\n    plot.title = element_text(colour = 'black')\n  )\np\n```\n\nNotice that we have customized the theme elements via `element_*()` functions.\nBasically, each geom type like \"line\", \"rect\", \"text\", etc. has their own `element_*()` function.\nThe `theme()` function expects attributes to be changed using these.\nIf you are unfamiliar with this concept, maybe the corresponding part in my [YARDS lecture notes](https://yards.albert-rapp.de/statquant#themes) will help you.\n\n## Align labels\n\nAligning plot elements, e.g. labels, to form clean lines is another major aspect of the SWD look.\nBefore I read about it, I did not even notice it but once you see it you cannot go back.\nBasically, plots feel \"more harmonious\" if there are clear (not necessarily drawn) lines like with the left and right edge of the stacked bars.\nBut this concept does not stop with the bars and can be used for the labels too.\nLet's demonstrate that by moving the labels with more of `theme()`.\n\n```{r}\np <- p +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(hjust = 1),\n    plot.title.position = 'plot'\n    # aligns the title to the whole plot and not the (inner) panel\n  )\np\n```\n\nOnce again, the design enforces that important information like what's on an axis is in the top left corner.\nThis was done by changing `hjust`. \nIn this case `hjust = 0` corresponds to left-justified whereas `hjust = 1` corresponds to right-justified.\nOf course, `vjust` works similarly.\nFor more details w.r.t. `hjust` and `vjust`, check out [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7263849/what-do-hjust-and-vjust-do-when-making-a-plot-using-ggplot) that gives you everything that you need in one visual.\nFor your convenience, here is a slightly changed form of that visual.\n\n```{r, echo = F}\ntd <- expand.grid(\n    hjust=c(0, 0.5, 1),\n    vjust=c(0, 0.5, 1),\n    text=\"text\"\n)\n\nggplot(td, aes(x=hjust, y=vjust)) + \n    geom_point(size = 4, col = 'red') +\n    geom_text(size = 7, aes(label=text, hjust=hjust, vjust=vjust)) + \n    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0, 0.5, 1), expand=c(0, 0.2)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0, 0.5, 1), expand=c(0, 0.2))\n```\n\n\nBut once you start aligning the axes titles, you notice that the 0% and 100% labels fall outside the grid.\nWe could try to set `hjust` of `axis.text.x` in `theme()` but sadly this is not vectorized.\nSubsequently, all `hjust` values must be the same.\nThat's not bueno.\nTherefore, I drew the axes labels manually with `annotate()` but make sure that you remove the current labels in `scale_x_continuous()`.\nAlso, now you know why we had to set `clip = 'off'` earlier.\nThe axes labels are outside of the regular panel.\n\n```{r}\np <- p +\n  # Overwriting previous scale will generate a warning but that's ok\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2), # We still want the axes ticks\n    labels = rep('', 6), # Empty strings as labels\n    position = 'top'\n  ) +\n  annotate(\n    'text',\n    x = seq(0, 1, 0.2),\n    y = 20.75,\n    label = scales::percent(seq(0, 1, 0.2), accuracy = 1),\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = c(0, rep(0.5, 4), 1),\n    # individual hjust here\n    vjust = 0, \n    col = unhighlighed_col_darker\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = 0)\n    # change vjust to avoid overplotting\n  )\np\n```\n\n## Add text labels\n\nThe same trick can be used to add the category description (accuracy, null, error) to the right top corner and label the highlighted bars.\nFor the latter part, we simply extract the corresponding rows from our data and use that in conjunction with `geom_text()`.\n\n```{r}\ntext_labels <- colored_dat %>% \n  filter(type == 'error', percent > 0.1) %>% \n  mutate(percent = scales::percent(percent, accuracy = 1))\n\np <- p +\n  geom_text(\n    data = text_labels, \n    aes(x = 1, label = percent), \n    hjust = 1.1,\n    col = 'white',\n    size = 4\n  )\np\n```\n\nNotice that I used a `hjust` value greater than 1 here to add some white space on the right side of the labels.\nOtherwise, the percent sign will be too close to the bar's edge.\n\nNext, we add the category descriptions.\nThis is a bit more tricky, though, because we want to highlight a word too,\nSo, we will add a `richtext` as described [in my previous blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-02-19-ggplot2-color-tips-from-datawrapper/#label-directly).\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggtext)\np <- p +\n  annotate(\n    'richtext',\n    x = 1,\n    y = 21.25,\n    label = \"ACCURATE | NULL | <span style = 'color:#E69F00'>ERROR</span>\",\n    hjust = 1,\n    vjust = 0, \n    col = unhighlighed_col_darker, \n    size = 4,\n    label.colour = NA,\n    fill = NA\n  )\np\n```\n\n\n\n## Add story text\n\nNow that the bar plot is finished we can work on the story text.\nFor that, we create another plot that contains only the text.\nLater on, we will combine both of our plots with the `patchwork` package.\nThere are no really knew techniques here, so let's get straight to the code.\n\n```{r}\n# Save text data in a tibble\ntib_summary_text <- tibble(\n  x = 0, \n  y = c(1.65, 0.5), \n  label = c(\"<span style = 'color:grey60'>OVERALL:</span> **The error rate is 10% across all<br>66 warehouses**. <span style = 'color:grey60'>The good news is that<br>the accuracy rate is 85% so we\\'re hitting<br>the mark in nearly all our centers due to<br>the quality initiatives implemented last year.</span>\",\n  \"<span style = 'color:#E69F00'>OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE:</span> <span style = 'color:grey60'>10 centers<br>have higher than average error rates of<br>10%-16%.</span> <span style = 'color:#E69F00'>We recommend investigating<br>specific details and **scheduling meetings<br>with operations managers to<br>determine what's driving this.**</span>\"\n  )\n)\n\n# Create text plot with geom_richtext() and theme_void()\ntext_plot <- tib_summary_text %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_richtext(\n    aes(x, y, label = label),\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = 0,\n    vjust = 0,\n    label.colour = NA\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 2), clip = 'off') +\n  # clip = 'off' is important for putting it together later.\n  theme_void()\ntext_plot\n```\n\n\n## Add main message as new title and subtitle\n\nAs I said before, we will put the two plots together with `patchwork`.\nIf you have never dealt with `patchwork`, feel free to check out my short [intro to patchwork](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2021-10-28-extend-plot-variety/).\nPutting the plots together gives us another opportunity: \nWe can now set additional titles and subtitles of the **whole** plot.\nUse these to add the main message of your plot.\n\nBut make sure that there is enough white space around them by setting the title margins in `theme()`.\nOtherwise, your plot will feel \"too full\".\nAdding spacing is achieved through a `margin()` function in `element_text()`.\nThough, in this case we use `element_markdown()` which works exactly the same but enables [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) like using asterisks for bold texts.\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n# Save texts as variables for better code legibility\n# Here I used Markdown syntax\n# To enable its rendering, use element_markdown() in theme\ntitle_text <- \"**Action needed:** 10 warehouses have <span style = 'color:#E69F00'>high error rates</span>\"\nsubtitle_text <- \"<span style = 'color:#E69F00'>DISCUSS:</span> what are <span style = 'color:#E69F00'>**next steps to improve errors**</span> at highest volume warehouses?<br><span style = 'font-size:10pt;color:grey60'>The subset of centers shown (19 out of 66) have the highest volume of orders fulfilled</span>\"\ncaption_text <- \"SOURCE: ProTip Dashboard as of Q4/2021.

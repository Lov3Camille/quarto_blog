as in calling the API every hour -\nthen you need to set up a Twitter app.\nYou can read up on how that works in the \"Preparations\" section of the [above blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system.html).\nOnce you've got that down, your `rtweet` calls can be authenticated through your\nTwitter app like so.\n\n```{r}\nauth <- rtweet::rtweet_app(\n  bearer_token = keyring::key_get('twitter-bearer-token', keyring = 'blogpost')\n)\nauth_as(auth)\n```\n\nHere, I have used the `keyring` package to hide the bearer token of my Twitter app.\nIf that doesn't mean anything to you, let me once again refer to the [above blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system.html).\nThe important thing is that after these lines ran your `rtweet` calls get funneled through your\nown Twitter app.\n\n## Working with lubridate\n\nAs you saw above, the timeline that we extracted and saved in `rtweet` contains\ntime data.\nHere it is once again.\n\n```{r}\ntl_slice\n```\n\nSadly, working with times and dates is rarely pleasant.\nBut we can make our life a bit easier by using the `lubridate` package which was made for that.\nTo show you how it works, it is probably best to show you a couple of use cases.\n\nAll of these will be taken from what I had to deal with to create my celebratory\nvisualization.\nBut I simplified it to minimal examples for this blog post.\nMore use cases can be found in the [lubridate cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/lubridate.pdf) or the [tidyverse cookbook ressource](https://bookdown.org/Tazinho/Tidyverse-Cookbook/dates-and-times.html) by Malte Grosser.\n\n### Parse dates and times\n\n**EDIT July 13, 2022:** After moving my blog to quarto, `{rtweet}` updated its default output format. Now, parsing dates and times is not necessary anymore.\nI leave this section in here because the code may still be helpful in other situations.\n\nFirst, I needed to convert the `created_at` column from `character` to `datetime` format.\nThe easiest way to do that gets rid of `+0000` in the character vector and then\nparses the vector into the right format via `parse_date_time()`.\nBut there is a catch. \nCheck out what happens if I try this on my computer.\n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\n#| mesage: false\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(lubridate)\ntl_slice %>% \n  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(\n    str_remove(created_at, '\\\\+0000'), # remove the +0000 \n    orders = 'a b d H:M:S Y'\n  ))\n```\n\nSee how all values in `created_at` are `NA` now?\nThat's a problem.\nAnd we will solve it very soon.\nBut first, let me explain how the function call works.\n\nThe `orders` argument specifies how the vector `created_at` (without `+0000`) is to be understood.\nWe clarify that `created_at` contains (in the order of appearance)\n\n1. abbreviated week day names (`a`)\n2. abbreviated month names (`b`)\n3. the day of the month as decimals (`d`)\n4. and so on\n\nWhere do these abbreviations `a`, `b`, `d`, etc. come from?\nThey are defined in the help page of `parse_date_time()`.\nYou can find them in the section \"Details\".\nBut why does the code not work? \nWhy do we always get an `NA`?\nFor once, my computer is truly the problem.\nOr rather, its settings.\n\nBy default, my computer is set to German.\nBut even if RStudio or R's error messages are set to English, my computer's so-called\n\"locale\" may be still be set to German.\nThat's a problem because abbreviations like \"Sat\" and \"Wed\" refer to \nthe **English** words \"Saturday\" and \"Wednesday\".\nSo, we need to make sure that `parse_date_time()` understands that it needs to use\nan English locale.\nThen, everything works out.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nparsed_highlights <- tl_slice %>% \n  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(\n    str_remove(created_at, '\\\\+0000'), # remove the +0000 \n    orders = 'a b d H:M:S Y',\n    locale = \"en_US.UTF-8\"\n  ))\nparsed_highlights\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nlibrary(lubridate)\nparsed_highlights <- tl_slice\n```\n\n\nWe are now ready to send this data to ggplot.\nSince `created_at` is formatted in datetime now, ggplot will understand what it\nmeans when we map `x = created_at`.\n\n```{r}\nparsed_highlights %>% \n  ggplot(aes(created_at, favorite_count)) +\n  geom_line()\n```\n\n### Using scale_x_date(time) and locale\n\nDid you see that the x-axis uses German abbreviations and doesn't show what year we're in?\nThat's not great.\nLet's change that.\nAs is always the case when we want to format the axes we will need a `scale_*()` function.\nHere, what we need is `scale_x_datetime()`.\n\nBut this won't solve our German locale problem.\nThe easiest way to solve that tricky ordeal is to change the locale globally via `Sys.setlocale()`.\nDon't worry, though.\nThe locale will reset after restarting R.\nNo permanent \"damage\" here.\n\n```{r}\nSys.setlocale(\"LC_ALL\",\"en_US.UTF-8\")\np <- parsed_highlights %>% \n  ggplot(aes(created_at, favorite_count)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_datetime(\n    date_breaks = '2 months', # break every two months\n    date_labels = '%b %Y'\n  )\np\n```\n\nNotice that we have once again used the same abbreviation as for `parse_date_time()`.\nThis time, though, they have to be preceded by `%`.\nDon't ask me why.\nIt is just the way it is.\n\n### Create new dates\n\nLet us add a rectangle to our previous plot via an annotation.\nThis is similar to what I needed to do when adding my \"mysterious wonderland\" to my plot.\n\nSince the `x` aesthetic is formatted to datetime, we have to specify dates\nfor the `xmin` and `xmax` aesthetic of our annotation.\nTherefore, we need to create dates manually.\nIn this case, `make_datetime()` is the way to go.\nIf we're dealing only with dates (without times), then `make_date()` is a useful pendant.\nBoth functions are quite straightforward.\n\n```{r}\np <- p +\n  annotate(\n    'rect',\n    xmin = make_datetime(year = 2021, month = 11, day = 6, hour = 12),\n    xmax = make_datetime(year = 2021, month = 9), \n    ymin = 200,\n    ymax = 273,\n    alpha = 0.5\n  )\np\n```\n\n\n### Filter with intervals\n\nMaybe we want to highlight a part of our line.\nTo do so, we could filter our data to check whether certain date ranges correspond\nto parts that we want to highlight.\nUsually when we want to check if a value `x` is within a certain set of `objects` we use\n`x %in% objects`.\n\nTo do the same with dates, we need to create an interval with `interval()` first.\nThen, we can use that in `filter()` in conjunction with `%within%` instead of `%in%`.\n\n```{r}\nmy_interval <- interval(\n  start = make_date(year = 2022, month = 2), \n  end = make_date(year = 2022, month = 3, day = 10)\n)\n\np +\n  geom_line(\n    data = parsed_highlights %>% filter(created_at %within% my_interval),\n    color = 'red',\n    size = 2\n  )\n```\n\n### Calculations with times\n\nSay that you want to highlight the first five days after a certain date.\n(That's exactly what I did in my plot.)\nThen, you can simply add `days(5)` to this date.\nThere are similar functions like `minutes()`, `hours()` and so on.\nLet me show you how that may look in a visualization.\n\n```{r}\np +\n  annotate(\n    'rect',\n    xmin = parsed_highlights[[1, 'created_at']] - hours(24),\n    xmax = parsed_highlights[[1, 'created_at']] + days(5),\n    ymin = -Inf,\n    ymax = Inf,\n    alpha = 0.25,\n    fill = 'blue'\n  )\n```\n\n\n## Closing\n\nThis was a short intro to `lubridate` and `rtweet`.\nNaturally, the evolution of my follower count contained a lot more steps.\nIn the end, though, these steps were merely a collection of\n\n* techniques you know from my two previous storytelling with ggplot posts (see [here](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/10_recreating_swd_look/10_recreating_swd_look.html) and\n[here](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/11_rounded_rectangles/11_rounded_rectangles.html)) plus\n* data wrangling using times and dates with the functions that I just showed you.\n\nOnce

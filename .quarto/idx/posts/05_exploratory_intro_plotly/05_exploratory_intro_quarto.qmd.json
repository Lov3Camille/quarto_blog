Now, the issues with the theme do not persist anymore. \nHowever, I have left the remaining blog post unchanged.\n\n## From ggplot2 to plotly\n\nLet us begin by transforming a ggplot to a plotly plot.\nUsing a built-in function from the `plotly` package, it is straight-forward to convert a ggplot.\n\n```{r, message=F, warning = F}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\np <- mpg %>% \n  ggplot(aes(hwy, cty, fill = class)) +\n  geom_jitter(shape = 21, size = 2, alpha = 0.5)\n\nplotly_p <- ggplotly(p) \nplotly_p \n```\n\nMarvel at what one can do here:\n* Get additional information by hovering your cursor over a point\n* Filter classes by clicking on the corresponding legend items\n* Click and draw a rectangle with your cursor to zoom into the plot \n\nBut there is one thing that bothers me.\nIf I move the cursor across the plot window, then the plotly options bar at the top of the window overlaps the \"class\" legend label.\nCan I fix this by moving the legend to the bottom?\n\n```{r}\np <- p + theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\nggplotly(p)\n```\n\nHmm, it appears that the legend cannot be moved by this.\nDo other changes in `theme()` get registered?\nLet's check by applying a theme.\n\n```{r}\np <- p + theme_light()\nggplotly(p) \n```\n\nApparently, at least some changes will be conducted.\nLet's see, if I can use `layout()` as shown in the [getting started documentation of plotly](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/getting-started/#cutomizing-the-layout) to move the legend.\n\nThe R documentation of the `layout()` function is somewhat minimalistic.\nBasically, it refers to the [online plotly reference manual](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#Layout_and_layout_style_objects).\nUsing the table of content on that website, one can easily find the [layout options](https://plotly.com/r/reference/layout/#layout-showlegend).\n\nI believe the options `xanchor` and `yanchor` are exactly what I need as both of them can be set to options like `left`, `bottom`, etc.\nThough, I wonder why the value `auto` was not changed by `ggplotly()` as the initial plot `p` contains `legend.position = \"bottom\"`.\n\nIn any case, I am not a hundred percent sure what kind of syntax `layout()` requires.\nAn example in the R documentaion would have been nice.\nWell, let's try the straight-forward approach then.\n\n```{r, eval = T, results = 'hide'}\np %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(xanchor = \"center\")\n```\n\nWell, that didn't go as expected, but the warning displays valid attributes and `legend` is among them.\nUpon closer inspection, I also realize that, according to the reference manual, `xanchor` and `yanchor` have parent `layout.legend`.\nSo, I guess, I will have to use this somehow.\nMaybe, pass a list to `legend` via `layout()`?\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(legend = list(xanchor = \"center\")) \np_layout\n```\n\nAha!\nAt least this did not crash again but the resulting plot does not look as I would expect it to.\nLet's see what happens when we change `yanchor` as well and then we'll go from there.\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(legend = list(\n    xanchor = \"center\",\n    yanchor = \"bottom\"\n  )) \np_layout\n```\n\nUnsurprisingly, this did not help at all.\nIn retrospect, I don't know how I could think that changing `yanchor` as well would magically cure things.\nAgain, referring back to the manual (I should really read the descriptions instead of relying on the possible values), it appears that `xanchor` only sets a reference points for the option `x`.\nSame thing for `yanchor` and `y`.\n\nSo, how about changing `x` and `y` instead?\nPossible values for both options range from -2 to 3, so my best guess is that ranges from 0 to 1 refer to the window the points are plotted in.\nConsequently, moving the legend to the bottom could be as easy as using a positive `x` value and negative `y` value which are both close to zero.\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(legend = list(x = 0.1, y = -0.1))\np_layout\n```\n\nNow, this brings us closer to what I had in mind when I set `legend.position = \"bottom\"` in `theme()`.\nPossibly, we can change the orientation of the legend from vertical to horizontal, tweak the `x` and `y` values a bit and then we're there.\nScrolling through the manual (again), reveals that there is an option `orientation` which can be set to `h`.\nThis sounds promising.\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(legend = list(\n    x = 0.1, \n    y = -0.2, \n    orientation = \"h\"\n  )) \np_layout\n```\n\nNice!\nFinally, I am satisfied.\nOut of curiosity, let us investigate what had happened, if we had set orientation to `\"h\"` from the start.\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\")) \np_layout\n```\n\nThis already looks nice enough, so our manual tweaking was not technically necessary.\nBut then again, this does not recreate what `legend.position = \"bottom\"` usually does.\nNow that we understand how `layout()` works, we can roam the reference manual and try to tweak the legend box.\nLet's try to change a couple of things.\nThis does [not have to be pretty](https://www.allisonhorst.com/post/do-your-worst/), we only want to see how plotly works.\n\n```{r}\np_layout <- p %>% \n  ggplotly() %>% \n  layout(\n    legend = list(\n      orientation = \"h\",\n      borderwidth = 3,\n      bgcolor = \"grey\",\n      bordercolor = \"red\",\n      font = list(\n        color = \"white\",\n        family = \"Gravitas One\",\n        size = 15\n      ),\n      title = list(\n        text = \"Class\",\n        side = \"top\",\n        font = list(\n          color = \"white\",\n          family = \"Gravitas One\",\n          size = 15\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  ) \np_layout\n```\n\nNote how we have used lists in lists (in lists) to customize the legend.\nInterestingly, our initial blunder of ignoring the \"parent\" resp. the hierarchy of options earlier helped to understand that as an option's parent's name gets longer, e.g. `layout.legend.title.font`, we will have to use more convoluted lists to change that option. \n\n## Creating a Plotly Chart Manually\n\nSince we have learned how to tweak a plotly object, we might as well figure out how to create one without having to use `ggplotly()`.\nIt is not that I want to avoid using ggplot altogether but, in principle, it cannot hurt if we can understand plotly's implementation in the R package `plotly`.\n\nSo, from the book [Interactive web-based data visualization with R, plotly, and shiny](https://plotly-r.com/index.html) I gather that the `plotly` R package implements the JavaScript `plotly.js` library via a Grammar of Graphics approach.\nThus, it works similar to `ggplot2` in the sense that we can add layers of graphical objects to create a plot.\nIn `plotly`'s case, we pass a plotly object from one `add_*` layer to the next (via `%>%`).\n\n```{r}\nplt <- mpg %>% \n  plot_ly() %>% \n  add_markers(x = ~hwy, y = ~cty, color = ~class)\nplt\n```\n\nNotice the `~`.\nThese are used to ensure that the variables are mapped from the data (similar to `aes()` in `ggplot2`).\nAlternatively, one could also use `x = mpg$hwy` to create the same plot.\n\nBecause we can see a lot of overplotting, let us jitter the points.\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a built-in option for that.\nTherefore, let's do the jittering manually.\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123)\njitter_hwy <- 2\njitter_cty <- 1\njittered_mpg <- mpg %>% \n  mutate(\n    hwy = hwy + runif(length(hwy), -jitter_hwy, jitter_hwy),\n    cty = cty + runif(length(cty), -jitter_cty, jitter_cty)\n  )\nplt <- jittered_mpg %>% \n  plot_ly() %>% \n  add_markers(x = ~hwy, y = ~cty, color = ~class)\nplt \n```\n\nRegarding the customization of the points aka markers, we can pass a list of options (taken from the reference manual again) to the `marker` argument in `add_markers()`.\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123)\nplt <- jittered_mpg %>% \n  plot_ly() %>% \n  add_markers(\n    x = ~hwy, \n    y = ~cty, \n    color = ~class,\n    marker = list(\n      size = 8,\n      opacity = 0.6,\n      line = list(color = \"black\", width = 2)\n    )\n  ) \nplt\n```\n\nAlternatively, and what I find surprisingly convenient, we can leave our initial plotly object as it is and pass it to the `style()` function.\nThis functions works just like the `layout()` function we have seen before.\n\n```{r}\nplt <- jittered_mpg %>% \n  plot_ly() %>% \n  add_markers(\n    x = ~hwy, \n    y = ~cty, \n    color = ~class\n  ) %>% \n  style(\n    marker = list(\n      size = 8,\n      opacity = 0.6,\n      line = list(color = \"black\", width = 2)\n    )\n  ) \nplt \n```\n\nSimilarly, we could pass this along to `layout()` if we want to customize the legend box again.\n\n```{r}\nplt_layout <- plt %>% \n  layout(\n    legend = list(\n      orientation = \"h\",\n      borderwidth = 3,\n      bgcolor = \"grey\",\n      bordercolor = \"red\",\n      font = list(\n        color = \"white\",\n        family = \"Gravitas One\",\n        size = 15\n      ),\n      title = list(\n        text = \"Class\",\n        side = \"top\",\n        font = list(\n          color = \"white\",\n          family = \"Gravitas One\",\n          size = 15\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\nplt_layout\n```\n\nInteresting!\nFor some obscure reason the exact same legend command behaves differently now.\nHonestly, I have no clue what is going on here.\nIf I had to hazard a guess, I would say that during the conversion of a ggplot object to a plotly object via `ggplotly()` some default values were implemented that cause the change but this is just a hunch.\nPossibly, this is connected to `xanchor` or `yanchor`.\n\nIn any case, we got a glimpse of how the `plotly` R package works which uses the JavaScript library `plotly.js` to create interactive plots.\nAlso, we have learned how to convert a ggplot2 object to a plotly object and how we can customize this further.\n\nInterestingly, when converting from ggplot2 to plotly, the pop-up window that appears when you hover over a point is already customized compared to the default from `plot_ly()`.\nDid you notice the difference already?\n\nSo, in order to end our \"exploratory introduction\" let us adjust the `hovertemplate` according to the description in the reference manual.\nHere, we will use `\\n` for line breaks.\n\n```{r}\nplt <- plt %>% \n  style(hovertemplate = \"hwy: %{x:.2f}\\ncty: %{y:.2f}\") %>% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", y = -0.2)) \nplt\n```\n\nNotice how the class labels appear outside of the box.\nThe reference manual refers to this position as \"secondary\" box.\nTo get rid of this, we simply add `<extra></extra>` to our hover template.\nUnfortunately, it appears as if what is not displayed in the primary box cannot be used as part of the hover template.\n\nThus, we cannot use `%{color}`.\nInstead, we simply map `class` to the `text` attribute of the markers as well.\nThen, we can use `%{text}`.\n\n```{r}\nplt <- jittered_mpg %>% \n  plot_ly() %>% \n  add_markers(x = ~hwy, y = ~cty, color = ~class, text = ~class) %>% \n  style(\n    marker = list(\n      size = 8,\n      opacity = 0.6,\n      line = list(color = \"black\", width = 2)\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  style(hovertemplate = \"hwy: %{x:.2f}\\ncty: %{y:.2f}\\nclass: %{text} <extra></extra>\") %>% \n  layout(legend = list(orientation = \"h\", y = -0.2))\nplt\n```\n\n\nAll right! \nThat's enough exciting plotting action for today.\nHope you enjoyed this blog post and see you next time."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"message":false,"collapse":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["code-filename"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"include-after-body":["../../footer.html"],"output-file":"05_exploratory_intro_quarto.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.35","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"../../theme.scss"},"title-block-banner":false,"author":"Albert

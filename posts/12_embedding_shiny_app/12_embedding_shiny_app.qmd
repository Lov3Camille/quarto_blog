Today's a short blog post.
It's mainly for sharing a cool trick I just learned.

Here's a simple template to incorporate your Shiny app into an HTML file.
For instance, you can incorporate your shiny app into your blog post like I do here.
Simply exchange the src argument by your Shiny app's URL and then you're good to go.
Here, I use the app that I have [shown you a couple of months ago](../08_drawing_ggplot_interactively/08_drawing_ggplot_interactively.html).

```
<iframe src="https://rappa.shinyapps.io/interactive-ggplot" data-external="1" width="925px" height="800px">
</iframe>
```

From what I could tell, this is same code that `knitr::include_app()` drops.
But including the `iframe` manually let's you adjust the width **and** height of your
frame.
Beware that you will have to choose the dimensions large enough for your Shiny app.

UPDATE: Originally, I had demonstrated the above code chunk here. 
But that causes unnecessary traffic on my shinyapps.io account, so I removed the demo.

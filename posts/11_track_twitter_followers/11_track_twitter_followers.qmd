This week, I am oddly proud to announce that I have reached 1000 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rappa753).
Check out the visualization that I have created for this joyous occasion.

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics('final_viz.png')
```

To me, my rising follower count and the somewhat regular mails that I receive are a 
sign that people like to read my blog.
And to thank you all for following my work, let me give you a quick intro to the
packages `rtweet` and `lubridate`.
These were instrumental in creating the above visual.

## Working with rtweet

At the end of February 2022, I wondered how my follower count evolves over time.
Unfortunately, this is not something Twitter shows you by default.
The Analytics page only shows me the change within my last 28 days.
To overcome this drawback, I consulted the `rtweet` package which is a fabulous 
package that lets you interact with Twitter's API through R.

In my case, I only do rudimentary work with it and track my followers over time.
For this to work, I have set up an R script that runs every 
hour to download a list of my followers.
Each hour, the list's length tells me how many followers I have.

If you want to do the same, install the package first.
Make sure to install the development version from GitHub, though.

```{r}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("rOpenSci/rtweet")
```


### Basic functionalities

`rtweet` comes with a lot of convenient function.
Most of these start with `get_`.
For instance, there are

* `get_followers()`: This is the function to get a list of an account's followers.
* `get_timeline()`: This gives you the a user's timeline like tweets, replies and mentions.
* `get_retweets()`: This gives you the most recent retweets of a given tweet.

My aforementioned R script just runs `get_followers()` and
computes the number of rows of the resulting tibble.

```{r}
#| echo: false

keyring::keyring_unlock('blogpost', 'blog-dummy-password')
auth <- rtweet::rtweet_app(
  bearer_token = keyring::key_get('twitter-bearer-token', keyring = 'blogpost')
)
rtweet::auth_as(auth)
```

```{r}
library(rtweet)
tib <- get_followers('rappa753')
tib
nrow(tib)
```



For my above visualization, I used `get_timeline()` to extract my five most popular tweets.
Here, I ranked the popularity by the count of likes resp. "favorites" as `rtweet` likes to call it.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
tl <- get_timeline('rappa753', n = 1000)
tl_slice <- tl %>% 
  slice_max(favorite_count, n = 5) %>% 
  select(created_at, full_text, favorite_count, retweet_count) 
tl_slice
```

Notice that I tweeted two of these before I started tracking my followers.
Consequently, I ignored them for my visualization.

Unfortunately, the `rtweet` package cannot do everything.
For example, the snapshot functionality `tweet_shot()` does not work anymore.
I think that's because the Twitter API changed.

This bothered me during the [30 day chart challenge](https://twitter.com/30DayChartChall) in April because I wanted to automatically extract great visualizations from Twitter.
But as `tweet_shot()` was not working, I had to call Twitter's API manually without `rtweet`.
If you're curious about how that works, check out my [corresponding blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system.html).
There, I've also explained how to set up a script that gets executed, say, every 
hour automatically.

### Setting up a Twitter app

This pretty much explains how `rtweet` works.
In general, it is really easy to use.
And if you only want to use it only occasionally, there is not much more to it.

However, if you want to use the package more often - as in calling the API every hour -
then you need to set up a Twitter app.
You can read up on how that works in the "Preparations" section of the [above blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system.html).
Once you've got that down, your `rtweet` calls can be authenticated through your
Twitter app like so.

```{r}
auth <- rtweet::rtweet_app(
  bearer_token = keyring::key_get('twitter-bearer-token', keyring = 'blogpost')
)
auth_as(auth)
```

Here, I have used the `keyring` package to hide the bearer token of my Twitter app.
If that doesn't mean anything to you, let me once again refer to the [above blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system/09_get_twitter_posts_into_your_notetaking_system.html).
The important thing is that after these lines ran your `rtweet` calls get funneled through your
own Twitter app.

## Working with lubridate

As you saw above, the timeline that we extracted and saved in `rtweet` contains
time data.
Here it is once again.

```{r}
tl_slice
```

Sadly, working with times and dates is rarely pleasant.
But we can make our life a bit easier by using the `lubridate` package which was made for that.
To show you how it works, it is probably best to show you a couple of use cases.

All of these will be taken from what I had to deal with to create my celebratory
visualization.
But I simplified it to minimal examples for this blog post.
More use cases can be found in the [lubridate cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/lubridate.pdf) or the [tidyverse cookbook ressource](https://bookdown.org/Tazinho/Tidyverse-Cookbook/dates-and-times.html) by Malte Grosser.

### Parse dates and times

**EDIT July 13, 2022:** After moving my blog to quarto, `{rtweet}` updated its default output format. Now, parsing dates and times is not necessary anymore.
I leave this section in here because the code may still be helpful in other situations.

First, I needed to convert the `created_at` column from `character` to `datetime` format.
The easiest way to do that gets rid of `+0000` in the character vector and then
parses the vector into the right format via `parse_date_time()`.
But there is a catch. 
Check out what happens if I try this on my computer.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| mesage: false
#| eval: false
library(lubridate)
tl_slice %>% 
  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(
    str_remove(created_at, '\\+0000'), # remove the +0000 
    orders = 'a b d H:M:S Y'
  ))
```

See how all values in `created_at` are `NA` now?
That's a problem.
And we will solve it very soon.
But first, let me explain how the function call works.

The `orders` argument specifies how the vector `created_at` (without `+0000`) is to be understood.
We clarify that `created_at` contains (in the order of appearance)

1. abbreviated week day names (`a`)
2. abbreviated month names (`b`)
3. the day of the month as decimals (`d`)
4. and so on

Where do these abbreviations `a`, `b`, `d`, etc. come from?
They are defined in the help page of `parse_date_time()`.
You can find them in the section "Details".
But why does the code not work? 
Why do we always get an `NA`?
For once, my computer is truly the problem.
Or rather, its settings.

By default, my computer is set to German.
But even if RStudio or R's error messages are set to English, my computer's so-called
"locale" may be still be set to German.
That's a problem because abbreviations like "Sat" and "Wed" refer to 
the **English** words "Saturday" and "Wednesday".
So, we need to make sure that `parse_date_time()` understands that it needs to use
an English locale.
Then, everything works out.

```{r}
#| eval: false
parsed_highlights <- tl_slice %>% 
  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(
    str_remove(created_at, '\\+0000'), # remove the +0000 
    orders = 'a b d H:M:S Y',
    locale = "en_US.UTF-8"
  ))
parsed_highlights
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(lubridate)
parsed_highlights <- tl_slice
```


We are now ready to send this data to ggplot.
Since `created_at` is formatted in datetime now, ggplot will understand what it
means when we map `x = created_at`.

```{r}
parsed_highlights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(created_at, favorite_count)) +
  geom_line()
```

### Using scale_x_date(time) and locale

Did you see that the x-axis uses German abbreviations and doesn't show what year we're in?
That's not great.
Let's change that.
As is always the case when we want to format the axes we will need a `scale_*()` function.
Here, what we need is `scale_x_datetime()`.

But this won't solve our German locale problem.
The easiest way to solve that tricky ordeal is to change the locale globally via `Sys.setlocale()`.
Don't worry, though.
The locale will reset after restarting R.
No permanent "damage" here.

```{r}
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","en_US.UTF-8")
p <- parsed_highlights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(created_at, favorite_count)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_datetime(
    date_breaks = '2 months', # break every two months
    date_labels = '%b %Y'
  )
p
```

Notice that we have once again used the same abbreviation as for `parse_date_time()`.
This time, though, they have to be preceded by `%`.
Don't ask me why.
It is just the way it is.

### Create new dates

Let us add a rectangle to our previous plot via an annotation.
This is similar to what I needed to do when adding my "mysterious wonderland" to my plot.

Since the `x` aesthetic is formatted to datetime, we have to specify dates
for the `xmin` and `xmax` aesthetic of our annotation.
Therefore, we need to create dates manually.
In this case, `make_datetime()` is the way to go.
If we're dealing only with dates (without times), then `make_date()` is a useful pendant.
Both functions are quite straightforward.

```{r}
p <- p +
  annotate(
    'rect',
    xmin = make_datetime(year = 2021, month = 11, day = 6, hour = 12),
    xmax = make_datetime(year = 2021, month = 9), 
    ymin = 200,
    ymax = 273,
    alpha = 0.5
  )
p
```


### Filter with intervals

Maybe we want to highlight a part of our line.
To do so, we could filter our data to check whether certain date ranges correspond
to parts that we want to highlight.
Usually when we want to check if a value `x` is within a certain set of `objects` we use
`x %in% objects`.

To do the same with dates, we need to create an interval with `interval()` first.
Then, we can use that in `filter()` in conjunction with `%within%` instead of `%in%`.

```{r}
my_interval <- interval(
  start = make_date(year = 2022, month = 2), 
  end = make_date(year = 2022, month = 3, day = 10)
)

p +
  geom_line(
    data = parsed_highlights %>% filter(created_at %within% my_interval),
    color = 'red',
    size = 2
  )
```

### Calculations with times

Say that you want to highlight the first five days after a certain date.
(That's exactly what I did in my plot.)
Then, you can simply add `days(5)` to this date.
There are similar functions like `minutes()`, `hours()` and so on.
Let me show you how that may look in a visualization.

```{r}
p +
  annotate(
    'rect',
    xmin = parsed_highlights[[1, 'created_at']] - hours(24),
    xmax = parsed_highlights[[1, 'created_at']] + days(5),
    ymin = -Inf,
    ymax = Inf,
    alpha = 0.25,
    fill = 'blue'
  )
```


## Closing

This was a short intro to `lubridate` and `rtweet`.
Naturally, the evolution of my follower count contained a lot more steps.
In the end, though, these steps were merely a collection of

* techniques you know from my two previous storytelling with ggplot posts (see [here](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/10_recreating_swd_look/10_recreating_swd_look.html) and
[here](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/ggplot2-tips/11_rounded_rectangles/11_rounded_rectangles.html)) plus
* data wrangling using times and dates with the functions that I just showed you.

For some reason, using other than the default font in plots has been a major problem for me in R.
Supposedly, one can use the `extrafont` package to manage all of that but I found it too cumbersome.
Instead, I found out that the `showtext` package can make my life easier.

Even though working with text in plot is not yet completely free of troubles, `showtext` has made many things easier.
Now, I can finally choose fonts freely and even use icons.
This blogposts gives you a how-to so that you can do that too.

## Import and Use Fonts with showtext

A great source for fonts is [Google's font page](https://fonts.google.com/).
What is great abut this page is that it can display texts in many different fonts.

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap='Screenshot from fonts.google.com'}
knitr::include_graphics('google-fonts.png')
```

Once we found a nice font, we can use its name to make it available within R.
This is done with `showtext`'s helpful `font_add_google()` function.
Let's import a couple of random fonts.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Packages that we will use in this post

library(tidyverse)
library(showtext)
library(ggtext)
library(gghighlight)

# Import fonts
# First argument = google name, 
# Secont name = font name in R
font_add_google('Lora', 'lora')
font_add_google('Lobster', 'lobster')
font_add_google('Anton', 'anton')
font_add_google('Fira Sans', 'firasans')
font_add_google('Syne Mono', 'syne')

# Important step to enable showtext font rendering!
showtext_auto()
```

Notice that we have also used `showtext_auto()`.
This is necessary for `showtext` to take over the show. 
Otherwise, the new fonts would not be usable.
Now, let's take a look at our new fonts.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
tib <- tibble(
  family = c('firasans', 'lora', 'lobster', 'anton', 'syne'),
  x = 0,
  y = seq(0.0, 1, length.out = 5),
  label = 'Showtext shows text. Wow. What an insight.'
)

tib %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = label)) +
  geom_text(family = tib$family, size = 13, hjust = 0, col = 'dodgerblue4') +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  theme_void()
```

You may wonder why we have used `coord_cartesian()` here. 
We did this in order to ensure that the x-axis is not centered at 0 and our example texts won't be outside of the plot.
Personally, I find this somewhat tedious but this can't be helped, I guess.
With text elements we always run at the risk of writing outside of the plot area.


Next, let's make our use of fonts somewhat more practical.
In my [last blog post](https://albert-rapp.de/post/2022-02-19-ggplot2-color-tips-from-datawrapper/), I stressed the use of highlighting a few important things instead of using many colors.
Combine this with direct labels instead of a legend and you get this plot I created using the Fira Sans font.

```{r, message = F, warning=F, echo = F}
# Some data wrangling
time_data <- read_csv("time-spent-with-relationships-by-age-us.csv") %>% 
  rename_with(
    ~c('Entitity', 'Code', 'Age', 'alone', 'friends', 'children', 'parents', 
       'partner', 'coworkers')
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = alone:coworkers, 
    names_to = 'person',
    values_to = 'minutes'
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age <= 80) 

# Color-blind safe colors
colors <- thematic::okabe_ito(8)[-6]

# Line plot
p <- time_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = minutes, col = person)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(15, 81), ylim = c(0, 525), expand = F) +
  scale_y_continuous(minor_breaks = NULL) +
  labs(x = 'Age (in years)', y = 'Minutes', col = 'Time spent')

age_40_plt <- p + 
  gghighlight(
    person %in% c('alone', 'children'), 
    age >= 38, 
    use_direct_label = F
  ) +
  geom_segment(x = 38, xend = 38, y = -Inf, yend = 300, linetype = 2, col = 'grey20') +
  labs(title = 'Emphasize just one or a few categories') 

age_40_text <- glue::glue(
  "Around the age of 40, we spent less <br> time with 
  <span style = 'color:{colors[2]};'>children</span> 
  and more <br> time <span style = 'color:{colors[1]};'>alone</span>."
)


create_plot <- function(font, anno_size = 12, theme_size = 32) {
  age_40_plt +
    labs(title = 'Label directly') +
    annotate(
      'richtext',
      x = 15,
      y = 400,
      label = age_40_text,
      hjust = 0,
      vjust = 0,
      family = font,
      lineheight = 0.5,
      size = anno_size,
      label.color = NA
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
      text = element_text(family = font, size = theme_size),
      plot.title.position = 'plot',
      plot.title = element_text(
        face = 'bold', 
        colour = thematic::okabe_ito(8)[6],
        margin = margin(t = 2, r = 0, b = 7, l = 0, unit = "mm")
      ),
      legend.position = 'none'
    )
}
create_plot('firasans')
```

Now, see what it would look like had I used the Lobster font instead.

```{r, echo = F}
create_plot('lobster', anno_size = 6, theme_size = 16)
```

Feels different doesn't it?
And this is still different than the Anton font.

```{r, echo = F}
create_plot('anton', anno_size = 5, theme_size = 16)
```

## Import and Use Icon Fonts with showtext

We can not only use regular text fonts but also icons with `showtext`.
For example, we may want to use one of the free [Fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
To do so, download the [newest version](https://fontawesome.com/download) and extract the .otf-files into your working directory.
These contain the font information that you need.
Importing these (and any other font for that matter) works with `font_add()` and the path to the .otf-files.
```{r}
# First argument = name in R
# Second argument = path to .otf-file
font_add('fa-reg', 'fonts/Font Awesome 6 Free-Regular-400.otf')
font_add('fa-brands', 'fonts/Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf')
font_add('fa-solid', 'fonts/Font Awesome 6 Free-Solid-900.otf')
```

Now that we imported the fonts, we can use `ggtext`'s `geom_richtext()` and some HTML wizardry to add icons to our previously imported fonts from Google.
But first, what we need is an icon's unicode identifier?
Uni-what?

The easiest way to find that is to stroll through the [Fontawesome icons online](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
Then, find one that matches the font you want to use, e.g. free and solid.
Finally, find it's unicode character in the corresponding popup menu.

```{r, echo = F, fig.cap='Screenshot from fontawesome.com. Unicode highlighted in yellow.'}
knitr::include_graphics('unicode-finder.png')
```

Once you got this, you can add `&#x` in front of the unicode and wrap `<span>` tags around it.
Within these tags, you will have to specify `font-family` so that the icon is rendered.

```{r, warning = F}
tib <- tibble(
  family = c('firasans', 'lora', 'lobster', 'anton', 'syne'),
  x = 0,
  y = seq(0.0, 1, length.out = 5),
  label = "Let's talk cash <span style='font-family:fa-solid'>&#xf651;</span>"
)

tib %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = label)) +
  geom_richtext(family = tib$family, size = 16, hjust = 0, col = 'dodgerblue4', label.colour = NA) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1)) +
  theme_void()
```

This way, you can also use icons in scatter plots.
Though, make sure to set `fill=NA` if you do not want to have white boxes around the icons.

```{r, warning=F}
tibble(x = runif(25), y = runif(25)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = "<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf651;</span>")) +
  geom_richtext(size = 12, label.colour = NA, fill = NA, col = 'dodgerblue4',) +
  theme_minimal()
```

You will notice that using the two previous code chunks will generate a lot of warnings about "native encoding".
So far, I have always been able to ignore these without any trouble. 
I really don't know why they appear.
And if you know, please let me know in the comments below.
